        `The Lakshmi Pooja
        One day, when Tukaram, known as Tuka, came home, he found his wife Jija performing a Lakshmi Pooja. Curious, he asked her what she was doing. Jija replied that she was performing a pooja for Rukmani. Puzzled by the sudden ritual, Tuka inquired about the occasion. Jija explained that an astrologer had advised her to do this pooja to gain more wealth.
        Tuka, a devout follower of Vitthal, gently reminded her that Vitthal would provide for all their family’s needs. He told her that there was no need to perform rituals with the expectation of material gain. However, Jija argued that she was praying to Rukmani, Vitthal’s wife, and saw no harm in it.    
        Kamyartha Bhakti
        Tuka explained that what she was practicing was kamyartha bhakti—praying to God with the expectation of receiving something in return—which he believed was not the right approach. Despite his advice, Jija continued with her poojas.   
        A few weeks later, Jija unexpectedly received some money. She bought new clothes for the children and herself, and even redeemed the mortgaged jewels. When Tuka came home for lunch and noticed the changes, he asked Jija what had happened. She proudly told him that she had reaped the benefits of doing the Lakshmi Pooja. Without a word, Tuka left the house, refusing to eat. 
        Tuka’s Disappearance
        Jija thought he might be angry but would return by night. When he didn’t return for three days, she assumed he had gone to Pandharpur, a place he often visited without informing her. However, as weeks passed and Tuka did not return, Jija grew worried.       
        Determined to find him, Jija set out for Pandharpur, almost 300 kilometers from Dehu. She searched for him there but couldn’t find him. She asked the other sadhus if they had seen Tuka, but they hadn’t seen him for over a month. Distressed, Jija prayed to Vitthal in the temple and decided to spend the night there.       
        The Divine Revelation
        That night, Vitthal appeared in her dream and told her that Tukaram was in Dehu, showing her the hill where he was sitting and singing his abhangs. He also mentioned that Tuka had not eaten since he left home.     
        The next morning, Jija rushed back to Dehu and climbed the hill to find Tuka. She saw him seated on a stone, weak and bearded, yet singing with the same fervor. Tears filled her eyes as she stood before him with folded hands.       
        The Reunion
        When Tuka finished his abhang, he asked Jija why she had come. He expressed his desire to remain isolated and sing praises of Vitthal. Jija, weeping, asked how she and their children would survive without him. Tuka, still feeling hurt, reminded her that with her newfound wealth from the Lakshmi Pooja, she didn’t need him anymore.
        Jija, crying, told him that he was more important to her than any jewels or money. Touched by her sincerity, Tuka asked her to distribute all the wealth to the poor and return to him as before. Jija complied, giving away their wealth, and returned to Tuka.
        Tuka sang some abhangs to advise and console her. Finally, they returned home together, their bond strengthened by the ordeal.

        `The Setting in Chinchwadi
        This story highlights the deep spiritual connection and generosity of Tukaram, a revered saint and poet in Maharashtra, as well as the faith and devotion of the villagers.
        In the village of Chinchwadi, now known as Chinchwad, near Pune, Tukaram was often invited to perform his sankirtans, singing his devotional abhangs. These bhajans would frequently continue until dawn, captivating the villagers and keeping them spiritually engaged.

        The Brahman’s Visit
        One day, a Brahman, who was a scholar of the Ramayana and needed funds for his daughter’s marriage, visited the village hoping to give a discourse and raise money. However, upon arrival, he saw that the villagers only began their day by 8 am, which he mistook for laziness. When he inquired, he learned that the villagers stayed up late due to Tukaram’s kirtans and only slept after these sessions.

        Realizing that the villagers were unlikely to be interested in his discourse, the Brahman decided to leave. When Tukaram heard about this, he went to the Brahman, prostrated himself, and requested him to stay and deliver the Ramayana discourse, promising that he, along with the villagers, would listen attentively. This gesture delighted the Brahman, who agreed to give a detailed discourse over forty-five days.

        The Miser’s Resistance
        During this period, a miser in the village refused to attend the discourse or allow his wife to do so, fearing the villagers would ask him for a contribution. To avoid this, he left the village before the discourse ended. When the organizers came to collect contributions, his wife, unable to offer money, gave them an old, leaking vessel used for washing legs.

        At the concluding ceremony, as donations were being presented to the Brahman, the organizers mockingly announced that the miser had donated a golden vessel and handed the old vessel to Tukaram. The miser’s wife, feeling regretful and wishing she could have given a golden vessel, watched. Tukaram, understanding her heart’s sincerity, miraculously transformed the vessel into gold.

        The Miracle and its Impact
        This miraculous act filled the miser’s wife with joy. The Brahman collected the gifts, grateful for the villagers’ generosity, and returned home to arrange his daughter’s marriage. Tukaram, having once again demonstrated his spiritual power and compassion, returned to Dehu.

        Lessons to Be Learned
        The Power of Devotion and Sincerity:

        The Consequences of Miserliness:

        The miser’s behavior and eventual embarrassment serve as a cautionary tale about the pitfalls of greed and selfishness. His unwillingness to contribute, despite having the means, contrasts sharply with the villagers’ generosity and underscores the social and spiritual isolation that miserliness can bring.
        Community and Collective Worship:

        description:
        `The Kirtan on Ekadasi
        One Ekadasi day, Tukaram was performing kirtans, and Shivaji, the Maratha king, was listening with great devotion. During this time, a large troop of 2,000 Muslim soldiers learned of Shivaji’s location and came to arrest him. They surrounded the house where the bhajans were being performed, not allowing anyone to enter or leave.

        The Imminent Danger
        Shivaji’s informers managed to get word to him about the situation. Worried, Shivaji was advised by one of his bodyguards to leave. However, Tukaram insisted that no one should leave until the kirtan was over. Trusting Tukaram and feeling the divine presence, Shivaji decided to stay, thinking that only Vitthal could save him, and if not, he would consider it an honor to die on an Ekadasi day while listening to abhangs in the company of saints.

        Divine Intervention
        A spy entered the house to identify Shivaji but couldn’t recognize him among the devotees. He reported this to his commander, who then ordered his soldiers to kill everyone inside, ensuring they would get Shivaji. At this critical moment, Vitthal took the form of Shivaji and rode out on a horse. The soldiers saw this and began to chase him.

        The Miraculous Escape
        The chase went on for several hours and covered about 40 miles into a dense jungle. Eventually, Vitthal, still in Shivaji’s form, disappeared, leaving the soldiers bewildered and blaming each other for failing to catch him. The commander was astounded that his army couldn’t capture one man.

        description:
        `Tukaram’s Shop is Looted
        One day, as usual, Tukaram’s shop was looted by miscreants while he was away with a group of pilgrims to Pandharpur. His wife, Jijabai, gave him some jewels and asked him to mortgage them to restock their provision store. He did so, collected the money, and was returning home when he encountered a group of beggars singing about Vitthal. Feeling moved, he distributed the money to them and returned home empty-handed.

        Tukaram’s Devotion and Jijabai’s Struggle
        Tukaram was deeply devoted to Vitthal and was always absorbed in chanting, singing, and dancing with tears in his eyes. He did not care for materialistic matters. Knowing this, Jijabai, understanding her husband’s nature, took up household work in the locality to feed their children.

        One morning, Tukaram saw Jijabai leaving for work and asked where she was going. She explained the financial situation and her need to earn money. Feeling bad, Tukaram promised to find work and support the family. He set out to find a job but faced a peculiar challenge. Everyone he approached recognized him as a saint and offered him free provisions, considering it an honor to serve him. Tukaram, however, did not want to accept charity.

        Tukaram Finds Work
        Realizing it was difficult to find work in Dehu, he decided to seek employment in a neighboring village. There, he met an old man with a large field and asked for work. The old man, liking Tukaram, asked him to guard the field from birds and animals for the next two months. Tukaram agreed and was given some grains to take home to his family.

        Tukaram’s Devotion Leads to Problems
        Tukaram, lost in devotion, saw every animal and bird as a manifestation of Vitthal and did not chase them away. He spent his time singing abhangs, oblivious to the damage being done to the crops.

        After two months, the old man returned to find his field destroyed. Angry, he confronted Tukaram, who sincerely apologized, explaining that he hadn’t noticed the destruction. The old man demanded compensation for the Rs. 2000 loss. Tukaram, having no money, begged the old man not to take him to the king, as the king was Shivaji, his disciple, who would pay the debt on his behalf.

        The Old Man’s Realization
        The old man, upon realizing he was speaking to the great saint Tukaram, prostrated before him and apologized for his harsh words. He then gave Tukaram a load of sugarcane to sell and support his family.

        Tukaram’s Generosity
        Tukaram, happy with the sugarcane, set off for home. Jijabai, delighted to hear that her husband had earned something, asked him to go to the market and buy provisions. On the way, Tukaram visited the temple, where children eagerly asked for the sugarcane. Moved by their requests, he distributed all the sugarcane to the children and joined them in singing and dancing.

        Jijabai’s Frustration and Realization
        When he returned home empty-handed, Jijabai asked if he had sold the sugarcane. Tukaram explained that he had given it to the children. Angry, Jijabai scolded him, but he smiled and gave her the last remaining sugarcane.

        In a fit of frustration, Jijabai hit him with the sugarcane, breaking it into two. Tukaram smiled and said that Vitthal had divided the sugarcane equally between them using her hands and his back. This made Jijabai realize the depth of Tukaram’s devotion and saintliness. She prostrated before him, apologized, and recognized his divine connection with Vitthal.

        `Tukaram’s Daily Devotion
        Tukaram, a revered saint, would sing abhangs daily, drawing many sadhus and bhagavathas who left with hearts filled with love for Vitthobha. However, in Dehu, there lived a man named Rameshwara Bhatt, well-versed in the dharma shastras, who grew jealous as people flocked to Tukaram’s kirtans while ignoring his own discourses.

        Bhatt’s Criticism
        Bhatt criticized Tukaram, calling him a Vysya who blabbered in Marathi without knowledge of the shastras. He claimed superiority as a Brahman who had studied the shastras and puranas and derided Tukaram for composing and singing his own poems.

        When Tukaram heard Bhatt’s criticism, he humbly approached Bhatt, prostrated himself, and asked if he had made mistakes in his abhangs. Bhatt chastised him for advising others without proper study and accused him of committing and leading others into sin.

        Tukaram’s Obedience
        In tears, Tukaram promised to follow Bhatt’s guidance, who demanded that he stop composing and singing abhangs and destroy all his existing compositions. Obediently, Tukaram gathered his compositions, tied them in a silk cloth, and took them to the river Indrayani. As he prepared to discard them, he reflected on their content, which praised Vitthal, nama mahima, guru mahima, Ekadasi, and stories of Prahalada and Dhruva.

        Despite his love for his compositions, he honored his promise to Bhatt and threw the bundle into the river. Feeling devastated, he sat by the riverbank, unable to sing the praises of Vitthal, crying out “Panduranga, Panduranga.”

        The Miracle
        The next morning, the temple priest in Dehu discovered a wet bundle on Vitthal’s head. Upon inspection, he found Tukaram’s compositions. The priest rushed to Tukaram and returned the bundle, explaining its miraculous appearance in the temple.

        Tukaram realized that Vitthal had validated his abhangs, showing there were no mistakes. Overjoyed, he understood Vitthal’s support. Rameshwara Bhatt, upon hearing of this miracle, ran to Tukaram, asked for forgiveness, and praised him as a mahatma.

        Tukaram’s Humility
        Tukaram, ever humble, refused to accept Bhatt’s apology, stating that Bhatt, a learned Brahman, had not erred. Instead, he saw this as Vitthal’s leela, demonstrating divine approval of his abhangs.

        Following this incident, Tukaram’s abhangs gained widespread fame, sung by many, and came to be known as the Vaishnava Veda.

        `The Story of Shivaji Maharaj and Tukaram
        Meeting of Two Great Souls
        Sant Samartha Ramadass and Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj were contemporaries of the revered saint Tukaram. Sant Ramadass, a spiritual guide to Shivaji, had heard of Tukaram’s greatness and encouraged Shivaji to meet him if he visited Dehu. Following his guru’s advice, Shivaji decided to meet Tukaram.

        Upon meeting Tukaram, Shivaji recognized his spiritual greatness and began to visit him frequently. Shivaji considered both Ramadass and Tukaram as his two guiding eyes and sought their blessings and advice for all his endeavors.

        The Gift of Gold
        One day, Shivaji wanted to present Tukaram with some gifts. He took a plate of gold coins and went to meet Tukaram. After placing the plate in front of Tukaram and prostrating to him, Tukaram started shivering, got up, and ran away. Perplexed, Shivaji asked the other disciples why Tukaram reacted this way.

        The disciples explained that Shivaji had always visited Tukaram alone, but this time he brought gold, which Tukaram did not like, prompting him to run away. Shivaji expressed his concern for Tukaram’s ability to feed the many sadhus who dined at his house daily and thought the gold would be helpful.

        Consolation and Understanding
        The disciples suggested Shivaji console Tukaram and bring him back. Shivaji went to Tukaram, apologized, and explained that although he knew Tukaram did not care for money, he thought the gold could help feed the sadhus after the bhajans and kirtans.

        Tukaram responded by saying that if Shivaji, having known him for only a few months, was worried about him, then surely Vitthal, who had known him since birth and across many lifetimes, would also care for him. Tukaram assured Shivaji that Vitthal would provide for their needs.

        Tukaram’s Detachment
        Shivaji persisted, requesting Tukaram to accept his offering for his happiness. However, Tukaram replied that accepting gold was akin to eating cow’s meat to please someone, stating that gold was as abhorrent to him as cow’s meat.

        Value of Spiritual Guidance:

        The story highlights the importance of spiritual guidance and blessings in making decisions, as Shivaji sought advice from both Ramadass and Tukaram for his actions.

        Shortly after the father left, the child died. The mother, inconsolable and enraged, carried the child’s body to Tukaram. She laid the body before Tukaram and cried out, “While our son was on his deathbed, his father said we should have complete faith in God and do nothing. Now you tell me, where is your Narayana?”

        Tukaram’s Divine Invocation
        The audience was stunned into silence. Tukaram, feeling deep sorrow for the mother, invoked Panduranga with heartfelt anguish. He prayed earnestly:

        “O Panduranga, we have read Your supremacy in the Puranas. We are merely Your servants. Only You can perform the miracle of bringing lifeless creatures to life! It is Your divine principle to avert the calamity of Your devotee. Hey Panduranga, kindly take pity on us and show Your prowess by bringing this dead boy to life.”

        He then uttered the couplet: “अशक्य ते तुम्हा नाही नारायणा” meaning: “There is nothing impossible for You, O Narayana.”

        The Miracle
        After his fervent prayer, Tukaram asked all the assembled devotees to chant the name of Panduranga loudly in unison. Immersed in devotion, the devotees closed their eyes and chanted fervently. When they opened their eyes, they found the boy had revived and was chanting the name of ShriHari along with them.

        The Aftermath
        This miraculous event confirmed Tukaram’s sainthood to everyone present. The news of the miracle spread rapidly through towns and villages, and Tukaram was hailed as a supreme saint.

        `The Brahmin’s Quest
        Tukaram, also known as Tukoba, had firmly concluded that the only way to liberation was through ShriHari namasmarana, the continuous chanting of the holy name of ShriHari. Despite his growing fame, Tukaram remained unaware and unconcerned about his reputation.

        One day, a learned Brahmin from a distant place came to meet Tukoba. Though well-versed in the scriptures, the Brahmin had not attained Self-Realization and felt discontented. He brought with him the treatise “Vivek Sindhu” written by Mukundaraj, a follower of Adi Shankaracharya’s Advaita philosophy and considered the first poet in Marathi literature.

        The Brahmin said to Tukoba, “Maharaj, I have read this treatise over and over again, but I have not attained Self-Realization. Could you please explain its meaning to me?” Tukoba humbly replied, “Hey, I am not a great scholar myself. Other than Haribhakti, I know nothing. What should I do for you?”

        The Reading of Vivek Sindhu
        The Brahmin persisted, “I will read the treatise in front of you; please explain its meaning to me.” Tukoba agreed, lay near him, and pulled a rug over his head and body. The Brahmin started reading, continuing page after page, but received no response from Tukoba.

        Curious, the Brahmin pulled the rug from Tukoba’s body and was shocked to see him immersed in Namasmarana with his fingers in his ears. Disappointed, the Brahmin said, “Maharaj, I came to you to know a suitable way to liberation. However, you have closed your ears while I read the treatise. What does it mean?”

        Tukoba’s Profound Explanation
        Tukoba sat up, smiled, and said, “Bhudev, God is everywhere and without achieving Him there is no liberation. One should not presume that a specific path alone would take him/her to God, which is akin to Dwaita Bhav (sense or feeling of duality). You have faith, therefore you can attain God.

        When someone does not attain God through his/her spiritual practice, it does not mean that the particular practice is inadequate to attain God; it is just that the amount of spiritual practice (sadhana) is inadequate. You must have faith in whatever spiritual practice you adopt for yourself. I have faith in Namasmarana. This is the only path I know. You came to me from a distant place, but I am not sure whether my answer would satisfy you. What more may I do?”

        The Brahmin’s Realization
        After listening to Tukoba’s clear and honest words, the Brahmin was extremely pleased. It was a kind of Guroopadesha (divine instruction) for him. He placed his head at Tukoba’s holy feet with great faith and devotion, thanked him profusely, and returned to his native place.

        The Brahmin, once filled with doubts, now returned with Bhakti (devotion). He had received the true path to liberation from Tukoba.

        Reflection on the Story

        Tukaram’s own practice of continuous chanting of the holy name demonstrates its power and efficacy in achieving divine connection and liberation.
        The Role of a True Guru:

        The story illustrates how a true guru can provide profound insights and clear doubts, leading a disciple to the right path with simple yet powerful guidance.
        Lessons to Be Learned
        Faith in Devotion:
        Believing deeply in the efficacy of one’s chosen spiritual practice is crucial for attaining spiritual goals.
        Acceptance of Multiple Paths:
        Recognize that there are various valid paths to the divine, and respect the diversity in spiritual practices.

        The Incident on Bhandara Hill
        One day, while climbing Bhandara Hill to bring Tukaram his food, Jijabai became tired. As she walked, a large thorn pricked her foot, causing her to fall and cry out in pain. Overwhelmed, she began to weep.

        Moved by Jijabai’s devotion and distress, Lord Panduranga appeared in his Sagun form as a shepherd. He gently removed the thorn from her foot and helped her to stand up. After ensuring she was alright, he left without revealing his divine identity.

        Tukaram’s Realization
        When Jijabai reached Tukaram and narrated the event, Tukaram instantly realized that it was none other than Lord Panduranga who had come to her aid. Deeply touched by the Lord’s compassion and concerned about causing him trouble, Tukaram decided to change his practice.

        Tukaram’s New Resolution

        image: "/id11.jpg",
        description:
        `The Story of Tukkaram’s Patience
        Once, Tukkaramji, the great saint, was sitting near the bank of the Ganges, immersed in bhajans. An envious person wanted to disturb Tukkaram and provoke him into a fight, so he spat on his face. Tukkaram calmly got up, went to the river, took a holy dip, and returned to continue his bhajans.

        The man repeated his actions 108 times, and each time, Tukkaram repeated his calm response without showing any irritation or anger. In the end, the envious man grew tired and frustrated. He asked, “How come you are not becoming angry?”

        Tukkaram replied, “Why should I become angry? I should actually thank you. Because of your mercy, I took bath 108 times in the Ganges.”

        Moral of the Story
        This story highlights an extraordinary level of tolerance and the ability to see the divine hand in every experience. Tukkaram’s response teaches us several valuable lessons:

        Lessons to be Learned
        Tolerance and Patience:
        Tukkaram’s ability to remain calm and patient in the face of repeated provocation is a profound demonstration of tolerance. Instead of reacting with anger, he maintained his composure and continued his devotional practice.
        Seeing the Divine in Every Experience:
        Tukkaram saw the spitting incident as an opportunity to take holy dips in the Ganges. He perceived every action, whether pleasant or unpleasant, as a part of Krishna’s plan and used it to his spiritual advantage.
        Gratitude in All Circumstances:
        Usually, we only thank people for favorable actions. Tukkaram, however, thanked the man for giving him the opportunity to bathe in the holy river. This teaches us to find gratitude even in challenging situations.
        Learning from Every Experience:
        Tukkaram’s attitude exemplifies the idea that every experience in life, whether good or bad, offers a lesson. We can learn from everyone and everything around us if we approach life with humility and an open heart.
        Reflection on Sanity of Mind
        This level of mental equilibrium and positive perception is achievable under the guidance of a spiritual master. By remembering the lives of great saints and observing our own experiences, we can learn the various lessons that Krishna has in store for us.

        In life, we encounter many different people and situations, each providing us with unique experiences that shape our character and behavior. These experiences, particularly those in childhood, can have a lasting impact.

        For instance:

        In households where parents exhibit negative behaviors, children can be influenced adversely. However, with proper guidance, children can learn valuable lessons about how not to behave.
        Experiences serve as powerful teachers. Good experiences teach us positive behaviors, while bad experiences teach us what to avoid.
        Scriptural Insight
        Lord Krishna, in Bhagavad Gita 16.6, describes the dual nature of beings:

        dvau bhuta sargau loke’smin / daiva aasura eva ca daivo vistarashah prokta / aasuram paartha me shrnu

        “O son of Prthaa, in this world there are two kinds of created beings. One is called the divine and the other demoniac. I have already explained to you at length the divine qualities. Now hear from Me of the demoniac.”

        By presenting examples of both divine and demoniac qualities, scriptures guide us on how to live righteously and what behaviors to avoid.

        Conclusion
        The story of Tukkaram and the spitting man is a powerful reminder of the importance of tolerance, gratitude, and learning from all experiences. By emulating the qualities of great saints and seeking the guidance of spiritual masters, we can navigate life’s challenges with grace and grow spiritually.

        Prayer
        Let us pray for the wisdom to remain tolerant, grateful, and to see the divine hand in all experiences:

        “O Supreme Lord Krishna, guide us to develop tolerance and gratitude in all situations. Help us to see Your divine hand in every experience and to learn valuable lessons from both favorable and challenging circumstances. May we grow spiritually and live a life of devotion, following the example of great saints like Tukkaram.”

        `The Devotees’ Distraction
        Once, Sant Tukaram, a great devotee of Lord Vitthaldev, was conducting a session of Hari Katha, narrating the divine pastimes of the Lord. The hall was packed with devotees, all eager to hear the spiritual teachings.

        As the night wore on, Sant Tukaram, lost in devotion, continued narrating and singing with his eyes closed. Gradually, the devotees began to leave. Some, feeling sleepy, even dozed off in the hall before eventually heading home. By midnight, Sant Tukaram opened his eyes and noticed that everyone had left except for one devotee who remained seated in front of him, listening intently.

        The True Motive Revealed
        Sant Tukaram, impressed by the apparent dedication of this devotee, said, “You are such a nice devotee of the Lord. You have so much devotion in your heart that, although everyone has left, you are still here, relishing Hari Katha.”

        However, the devotee humbly replied, “Maharaj, please do not misunderstand. I am not truly attached to Hari Katha. The reason I stayed so long is that the blanket on which you are sitting belongs to me. I have been waiting to take it back.”

        Moral of the Story
        It is challenging to remain engaged in Krsna Katha for long periods. Only a pure-hearted soul can relish Hari Katha constantly. Yet, hearing Krsna Katha is a crucial aspect of spiritual purification and helps in achieving the highest goal of life.

        As Prahlad Maharaj says, sravanam kirtanam vishno smaranam — hearing Krsna’s pastimes is the boat by which to achieve the ultimate goal of life.

        Parikshit Maharaj humbly asks in Srimad Bhagavatam (SB 10.12.42): tad bruhi me maha-yogin / param kautuhalam guro nunam etad dharer eva / maya bhavati nanyatha

        “O greatest yogi, my spiritual master, kindly describe why this happened. I am very much curious to know about it. I think that it was nothing but another illusion due to Krsna.”

        The pious activities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are very confidential. It is not ordinarily possible to hear such activities unless one is very, very fortunate. Parikshit Maharaj listened to Srimad Bhagavatam with rapt attention for many days without eating or drinking.

        For neophytes, it is difficult to wholeheartedly relish Hari Katha. During Katha, one might become sleepy, feel bored, constantly check the time, or think about other distractions such as prasadam.

        Encouragement for Devotees
        Hearing Krsna Katha is essential for spiritual growth. It purifies the heart and mind, paving the way to divine consciousness. Devotees are encouraged to develop a taste for hearing the pastimes of the Lord, as it brings immense spiritual benefits and ultimately leads to a deeper connection with the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
